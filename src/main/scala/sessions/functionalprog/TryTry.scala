  // Now, having this kind of exception handling code all over your code base
  // can become ugly very quickly and doesn't really go well with functional programming.
  // It's also a rather bad solution for applications with a lot of concurrency.
  // For instance, if you need to deal with an exception thrown by an Actor
  // that is executed on some other thread,
  // you obviously cannot do that by catching that exception â€“
  // you will want a possibility to receive a message denoting the error condition.
  //
  // Hence, in Scala, it's usually preferred to signify that an error has occurred
  // by returning an appropriate value from your function.

    //  returning a Failure containing the respective exception.

  // recovering from Failure

  // If you want to establish some kind of default behaviour in the case of a Failure,
  // you don't have to use getOrElse.
  // An alternative is recover, which expects a partial function and returns another Try.
  // If recover is called on a Success instance, that instance is returned as is.
  // Otherwise, if the partial function is defined for the given Failure instance, its result is returned as a Success.
